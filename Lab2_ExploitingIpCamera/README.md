# Lab 2: Exploiting an IP Camera (Writeup)
### Tools Needed
  IP Camera, Multimeter, Attify Badge, Jumper Wires, USB Cable, Soldering Iron, Attify OS, baudrate.py, rootpw.py, minicom 
### Introduction
  In this laboratory, the students explored Embedded Device Hacking. It started with the first exploitation technique, which is to gain root access via a serial communication interface technique. This was done with the most common serial on the embedded device, which is Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART). The device to be exploited is opened, the chipsets on the PCB are identified, the datasheets are located, the exposed UART ports are identified, and root access to the device is obtained through connections to the UART ports of the device. This lab is useful even for beginners who have not worked with hardware in the past as it guides the student through the entire process of identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting the hardware component of IoT devices.
### Methodology
  They first got introduced to the tools that they were going to use for this lab and what their functions were.  They later managed to identify each of the chips that were located inside of the camera and figured out what role they served by looking up each of their data sheets on Google. The main chips that were of interest were the **System on Chip (SoC)** which was described as the brain of the device, the **flash chip** which was used for data storage, and the **networking chip** which, as its name suggests, allowed the device to have networking capabilities. They located the **UART** pinouts above the SoC chip and used a multimeter to identify the **Receive (Rx)**, **the Transmit (Tx)**, and the **Ground (GND)** pins. Each of those pins were connected to the **Attify Badge** with jumper cables and they were paired with their other respective pins (Rxa to Txb, Txa to Rxb, GNDa to GNDb). They made sure that they would transmit energy by soldering them. They downloaded a virtual machine called **AttifyOS** into a computer in order to gain access to the badge. The badge was connected to the computer via a USB cable and with that they looked for the name **ttyUSB0** in the terminal to confirm that the badge had connected into the VM succesfully. Next, they looked for the baudrate of the device by typing in the command "$ sudo python baudrate.py" into the terminal and scrolled up and down the data until finding something that was readable. They typed in the command "Ctrl+C" and waited for the script to compile. The configuration was given a name and saved. That led to the program opening up the minicom tool which allowed them to look at the output and type commands into the device. After they pressed "Enter" various times, they saw the terminal prompt once again. They inputed some Linux commands such as "ls" and "pwd" which led to the program giving out an output, confirming that it had a root shell on the device.
### Step by Step with Images
### Problems
- Conflict between academic schedules to be able to continue with the progress of the lab
- Trouble downloading the necessary Virtual Machine (VM) to access the datasheets of the camera
- The students did not know which VM was needed for the lab
- The laptop that was used for the lab did not show that device was ready (ttyUSB0 or ttyUSB1) multiple times
- Not receiving an indication from the Multimeter that the pins were transmitting energy
