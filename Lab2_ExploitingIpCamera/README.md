# Lab 2: Exploiting an IP Camera (Writeup)
### Tools Needed
  IP Camera, Multimeter, Attify Badge, Jumper Wires, USB Cable, Soldering Iron, Attify OS, baudrate.py, rootpw.py, minicom 
### Introduction
  In this laboratory, the students explored Embedded Device Hacking. It started with the first exploitation technique, which is to gain root access via a serial communication interface technique. This was done with the most common serial on the embedded device, which is Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART). The device to be exploited is opened, the chipsets on the PCB are identified, the datasheets are located, the exposed UART ports are identified, and root access to the device is obtained through connections to the UART ports of the device. This lab is useful even for beginners who have not worked with hardware in the past as it guides the student through the entire process of identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting the hardware component of IoT devices.
### Methodology
  We first got introduced to the tools we were going to use for this lab and what their functions were.  We later identified each of the chips that were located inside of the camera and figured out what role they served for the camera by looking up each of their data sheets on Google. The main chips that we were interested in were the System on Chip (SoC) which was described as the brain of the device, the flash chip which was used for data storage, and the networking chip which, as its name suggests, allowed the device to have networking capabilities. After finding them, we located the UART pinouts above the SoC chip and used our multimeter to identify the Receive (Rx), the Transmit (Tx), and the Ground (GND) pins. We connected each of those pins to our Attify Badge with our jumper cables with their other respective pins (Rxa to Txb, Txa to Rxb, GNDa to GNDb) and made sure that they would transmit energy by soldering them. We then downloaded a virtual machine called AttifyOS into our computer so we could gain access to our badge. We connected our badge to our computer via a USB cable and looked for the name ttyUSB0 in our terminal to confirm that the badge had connected into our VM succesfully. Next, we looked for the baudrate of the device by typing in the command "$ sudo python baudrate.py" into our terminal and scrolled up and down the data until we found something that was readable. We use the command "Ctrl+C" and wait for the script to compile. We gave a name to the configuration and saved it which led us to the minicom tool. This allowed us to look at the output and type commands into our device. We pressed Enter various times until we saw the terminal prompt once again. We inputed Linux commands such as ls and pwd in which the program gave us an output, confirming that we had a root shell on the device.
### Step by Step with Images
### Problems
- Conflict between academic schedules to be able to continue with the progress of the lab
- Trouble downloading the necessary Virtual Machine (VM) to access the datasheets of the camera
- The students did not know which VM was needed for the lab
- The laptop that was used for the lab did not show that device was ready (ttyUSB0 or ttyUSB1) multiple times
- Not receiving an indication from the Multimeter that the pins were transmitting energy
