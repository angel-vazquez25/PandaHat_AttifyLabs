# Lab 2: Exploiting an IP Camera (Writeup)
### Tools Needed
### Introduction
  In this laboratory, the students explored Embedded Device Hacking. It started with the first exploitation technique, which is to gain root access via a serial communication interface technique. This was done with the most common serial on the embedded device, which is Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART). The device to be exploited is opened, the chipsets on the PCB are identified, the datasheets are located, the exposed UART ports are identified, and root access to the device is obtained through connections to the UART ports of the device. This lab is useful even for beginners who have not worked with hardware in the past as it guides the student through the entire process of identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting the hardware component of IoT devices.
### Methodology
### Step by Step with Images
### Problems
- Conflict between academic schedules to be able to continue with the progress of the lab
- Trouble downloading the necessary Virtual Machine (VM) to access the datasheets of the camera
- The students did not know which VM was needed for the lab
- The laptop that was used for the lab did not show that device was ready (ttyUSB0 or ttyUSB1) multiple times
- Not receiving an indication from the Multimeter that the pins were transmitting energy
